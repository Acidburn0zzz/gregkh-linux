Things I don't want to forget, might as well track them here.

 - cdev stuff

 - buy a power controller for ktest:

  - cross compilers from David Howwells http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cross/ into openSUSE.

  - make dev_printk() "smarter" about finding a "real" device to print from, to
    make it more useful for people (see input thread for why this is needed)

  - kernel patches to make llvm build/link
  	http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=llvm-setup.git;a=tree;hb=HEAD

  - remove __devX as it's pretty much pointless
