Things I don't want to forget, might as well track them here.

 - cdev stuff

 - buy a power controller for ktest:

 - dbg() removal from usb.h:
   regex from Joe:
	$ git grep --name-only -E "^\s*#\s*include\s*[\<\"]linux/usb\.h[\>\"]" | \
	xargs grep -El "\bdbg\s*\("|wc -l
	$ git grep --name-only -E "^\s*#\s*include\s*[\<\"]linux/usb\.h[\>\"]" | \
	xargs grep -E "\bdbg\s*\(" | wc -l

  - dev_hex_dump() to replace print_hex_dump() calls like dev_printk() does.
    Then make dev_hex_dump_warn(), dev_hex_dump_dbg(), which is what I really
    want.
    or maybe just use %*ph instead

  - cross compilers from David Howwells http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cross/ into openSUSE.

  - make dev_printk() "smarter" about finding a "real" device to print from, to
    make it more useful for people (see input thread for why this is needed)

  - kernel patches to make llvm build/link
  	http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=llvm-setup.git;a=tree;hb=HEAD

  - remove __devX as it's pretty much pointless
