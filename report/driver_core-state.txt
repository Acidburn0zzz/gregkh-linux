Subject: State of the Linux Driver Core Subsystem for 2.6.23-rc8

Here's a summary of the current state of the Linux Driver core
subsystem, as of 2.6.23-rc8.

If the information in here is incorrect, or anyone knows of any
outstanding issues not listed here, please let me know.

List of outstanding regressions from 2.6.22:
	- none known.

List of outstanding regressions from older kernel versions:
	- none known.


There are no currently open Driver core or sysfs bugs in bugzilla.


Future patches that are currently in my quilt tree (as found at
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/
) for the Driver core subsystem are as follows.  All of these will be
submitted for inclusion into 2.6.24, except as noted.  The diffstat of
these patches is included at the bottom of this message for those that
are interested.

	- HOWTO ja_JP updates
	- metric boatload of changes and tweaks to sysfs from Tejun.
	  These clean up the internal usage and implementation of sysfs,
	  and split sysfs from the kobject model a lot, fixing a lot of
	  problems along the way.  I can't thank him enough for this
	  work.
	- cleaned up the usage of struct subsystem some more by removing
	  some functions that are not needed, or only used by the driver
	  core.  Details on the api changes are below
	- cleaned up the usage of the kobject->name field and removed it
	  entirely.  This saves us some size on every kobject which
	  really adds up on those s390 31 bit boxes with 20,000
	  different block devices.
	- uevent environment variable handling has been made simpler,
	  and now hopefully, almost impossible to get wrong.  Previously
	  we were forcing every subsystem to open-code a lot of this
	  logic.  Thanks to Kay for this work.
	- global list of sysdev_drivers is removed, as no one was using
	  it at all.
	- the number of legacy ptys can now be dynamically specified on
	  the kernel command line, allowing people who refuse to fix
	  their old applications to be able to still run on newer
	  distros that want to limit this number at build time.
	- dmi sysfs code cleanups and fixes
	- block devices are moved from /sys/block to /sys/class/block.
	  This patch has been hanging around for almost a year now, and
	  hopefully we have worked out all of the kinks and userspace
	  boot breakages.  If anyone has any problems with this, please
	  let me and Kay know about it.  I'm hesitant to include it in
	  2.6.24 as it has recently changed and needs more testing.
	  Maybe it will go into 2.6.25.  Oh, udev has been able to
	  handle this for over a year, so there should not be any
	  problems with distros that are still supported.  It can also
	  be turned off with the CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED build option
	  for older distros.
	- new debugfs functions for people who like hex numbers
	- platform devices now have the "platform:" alias added to their
	  modalias to fix the recursive modprobe loops that Red Hat,
	  OLPC, SuSE, and Debian have reported in the current code.
	- some struct class_device to struct device conversions were
	  done for video and some various char drivers.  More of these
	  are on the way.
	- cdev kobject name cleanups.  The kobject name of a cdev does
	  not do anything, so it should not be set.
	- firmware collision fix between i2c and i2c-dev.
	- uevent files for bus and driver have been added.  SuSE has
	  shipped this for quite some time now.
	- if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not enabled, some more space is saved in
	  the uevent code.
	- the path to the uevent helper program (traditionally
	  /sbin/hotplug) can be specified in the kernel config.  This
	  keeps the kernel from having to call a program that is not
	  present 300+ times before init starts up, speeding up boot
	  time in theory.

New driver core api changes for 2.6.24:
	- debugfs_create_x8(), debugfs_create_x16(), and
	  debugfs_create_x32() have been added
	- struct kobject.name field has been removed.  Use
	  kobject_set_name() and kobject_name() to set and get the name.
	- uevent callbacks in the driver core and for kobjects have been
	  changed from:
	    int (*uevent)(struct device *dev, char **envp, int num_envp, char *buffer, int buffer_size);
	  to:
	    int (*uevent)(struct device *dev, struct kobj_uevent_env *env);
	  and struct kobj_uevent_env has been created to make it simpler
	  to create environment variables for uevents.
	- struct platform_device.id has changed from an u32 to an int.
	- the following functions have been removed either entirely or
	  from the global namespace:
		get_bus()
		put_bus()
		kset_set_kset_s()
		subsys_get()
		subsys_put()
		subsys_set_kset()
		subsystem_init()
	  All documentation and in-kernel users have been cleaned up.
	  There really wasn't many, if any users of these calls.

No known at this time, changes to the sysfs userspace visable structure
will happen in 2.6.24.

thanks,

greg k-h
