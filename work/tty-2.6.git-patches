Subject: [GIT PATCH] TTY/serial driver fixes for .39

Here are some small tty/serial fixes for the .39 tree.

It also includes a parport patch, as it seems relevant to the serial
drivers (resource conflict) and there's not a parport maintainer tree
anywhere that I know of.

Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty-2.6.git/ tty-linus

All of these patches have been in the -mm and -next trees for a while.

Patches will be sent to the linux-serial mailing list, if anyone wants
to see them.

thanks,

greg k-h
