Subject: [GIT PATCH] UIO patches for 2.6.22

Here are the UIO (Userspace I/O driver framework) patches for 2.6.22

They have been revamped from the last time you have seen them, and they
include a real driver, the Hilscher CIF DeviceNet and Profibus card
controller, which is being used in production systems with this driver
framework right now.  The kernel driver they replaced was a total mess,
with over 60+ ioctls to try to control the different aspects of the
device.  See the last patch in this series for more details on this
driver.

These patches include full documentation, are self-contained from the
rest of the kernel, and have been in the -mm tree for the past few
months with no complaints.

Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/uio-2.6.git/

Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.

thanks,

greg k-h
