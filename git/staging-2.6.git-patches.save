Subject: [GIT PATCH] STAGING patches for 2.6.33-git

Here is the big staging tree merge for your 2.6.33-git tree.

There are 2 merges within this pull, one generated by me due to the need
for a way to apply patches from different people that were modifying the
same file.  The other to merge the staging patches to your tree and
resolve some conflicts that were there due to changes done by the
wireless tree (which I knew was going to happen).  Then a final api
fixup patch was applied to get everything to build properly after the
merge (the wireless tree api changes missed one of the staging drivers,
no big deal).

There are a few new drivers in this merge, and a number of existing ones
are removed for a variety of reasons (duplicates of other in-kernel
drivers that are now working properly, authors asking for the code to be
removed, or lack of development effort.)

Everything is self-contained to the drivers/staging/ directory, which in
one case looks a bit odd (the patches for the dream android device which
are required because that arch does not look like it is ever going to be
merged through the correct channel any time soon, as the code needs lots
of work.)

The final diffstat shows that we did do a few more insertions than
removals here, but nothing major:
 478 files changed, 29064 insertions(+), 24384 deletions(-)

Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging-2.6.git/

All of these patches have been in the linux-next and mm trees.

The patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to the
driver-devel list for people to see.

thanks,

greg k-h
